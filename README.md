This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: multiple mutable borrows of the same variable.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to create two mutable references (`y` and `z`) to the same variable (`x`).  This violates Rust's borrowing rules, leading to a compile-time error. The solution in `bugSolution.rs` illustrates a way to refactor the code to avoid the error by using a single mutable reference or cloning the variable before creating the second reference.
